## About Me :wave:


Hey there! :smile: My name is Pâmela, I'm a Control and Automation engineer, I'm 23 years old, I'm from Colonel Fabriciano-Minas Gerais, and I'm looking for my first opportunity in the FullStack area.
At the beginning of college, I got to know the development area and fell in love, since then I haven't stopped studying every day.
I am currently focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and as a way of practicing, I develop several projects that I will always share here with you.
I recently took a Cybersecurity course because I believe that in addition to good code it is important to understand a little about security for better performance.
I am always in the process of continuous learning and would love to assist in open source projects to contribute and collaborate.
Determined, persistent, proactive, reasoning fast and rational, uses empathy for decision making. 

I always try to work with focused and objective people, who are developing interesting and proven projects!
Send me an email if you have any cool ideas [an e-mail](mailto:sezanapamela@gmail.com) we can talk and even have a cup of coffee :coffee:
